= pkgname

This is a small Go package to help me parse RPM and Debian package names
(I need it for another project at work).

More importantly, I want to use it to learn good prctices in Go programming.
Thanks to John Arundel (@bitfield) and exercism.io (@exercism) I fell in love with Go.
After developing a couple very simple programs now I want to do it more _seriously_,
with proper project organization, testing, documentation, etc.
This simple package gives me enough opportunities to practice.
