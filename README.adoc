= pkgname

This is a small Go package to help me parse RPM and Debian package names
(I need it for another project at work).

More importantly, I want to use it to learn good practices in Go programming.
Thanks to John Arundel (link:https://github.com/bitfield[@bitfield]) and 
exercism.io (link:https://github.com/exercism/go[@exercism]) I fell in love with Go.
After developing a couple very simple programs now I want to do it more _seriously_,
with proper project organization, testing, documentation, etc.
This simple package gives me enough opportunities to practice, I hope.
